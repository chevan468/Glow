# Glow
The purpose of this project is to analyze, develop and implement a software solution for a physiotherapy and esthetics clinic, making use of the Scrum Framework. The software solution consists of a website that will allow the clinic to show information of the clinic itself, its services, the products that it sells, and the ability to allow the customers to book services via internet and allow the administrator of the clinic to manage those bookings from an electronic device. The main idea is to help the clinic to inform the customers of everything it offers and to improve the booking process.
